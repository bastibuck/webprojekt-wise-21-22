  Insight into 2019 novel coronavirus â€” An updated interim review and lessons
  from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
  The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a
  zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has
  become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV
  should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help
  optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Based on recently published literature, official documents and selected
  up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin,
  epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV
  infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
  infection.
